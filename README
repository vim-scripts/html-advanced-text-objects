The inbuilt text object for html (cit cat) is great for the immediate tag but requires some additional movement if you have nesting. 
This plugin gives you some more text objects to play with eg 'cahf' (cut-around-html-form) 'cihb' (cut-in-html-body) , 'viht' (visual-inner-html-table) , 'gUihd' (go UPPERCASE in html div)

This is still very much a work in progress any ideas on mapping naming conventions/ bugs etc please contact me.
